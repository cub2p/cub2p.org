## Sanbonani y'all!!

Once again our CUB2P footbridge building squad is coming to you live from the wicked neat, small landlocked monarchy in southern Africa known as eSwatini!! These last few weeks have been an arduous, fulfilling, and, all things considered, *kahle kakhulu*!!

Since the last update, our team has been continuing to work hard *every day* on completing the footbridge. Working alongside the Ndlembeni community, we are relentlessly progressing forward in our bridge build.

And, in light of many *interesting* challenges, we've had heaps of progress on our bridge!!

## Construction Update

Here in Swaziland they have a saying, *"kancane, kancane"*, "*bit by bit...*" as a way that things happen. Here our team embraces that as both a way of life and the way our bridge constrution goes, as *"bit by bit"* our bridge is getting complete!

Here's what we've been getting done on construction! 

### Right and left side towers

*Mongisi and fam on the right side towers*

The mason at our bridge site is a lovely calm and patient older man named Mongisi and we are so happy to have him as a part of our bridge building family. He's a Swazi bricklayer whom we first worked with on the first Swaziland bridge last year at Edlangeni.

Mongisi made quick work of the left and right side towers, fuelled by buckets upon buckets of concrete mixed by other bridge family.

### Rock blasting

*Previously on CUB2P Swaziland: big ole' rocks*

On our last update you heard about the *tonnes* of issues that we ran into on our left side excavation---absolutely **huge** rocks that our team needed to move but had no way of moving.

Our method of burning tires and smashing the rocks grew old after doing it twice---it's super toxic to do, tough to clean out, and most critically could burn down our centerline (a string suspended in the air which all of our bridge measurements are made off of, super important to keep stable).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/rock-blasting-2.jpg)
*"Nothing like a little rock blasting in the morning!!"*

Coming in to save the day, our in-country partner Swaziland Microprojects brought in experts with big drills and compressors, to blast the heck of the solid granite boulders.

Early one Saturday morning the guys came in with a massive, tractor pulled portable air compressor, drilled into the rocks and then drove a wedge into the holes, and cracked the rocks open like crazy.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/rock-blasting-detail.jpg)

To watch the rocks that had given us grief for *weeks* be effortlessly blasted away by modern machinery was pure satisfaction; there were many sighs of relief from the peanut gallery who assembled to watch the action.

Those sighs of relief quickly turned to noggin' scratching as we realized we still had to get these "no longer massive but still pretty big boulders" out of the hole. They were too heavy to lift by hands, but were up too steep an incline to roll, so *eish* how are we going to get these rocks out?

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/pulley-system-2.jpg)

Our good ole' noggins got thinking once again as we discussed our options. Hmmm... we have a cable winch used to hoist the bridge cables, maybe we could try rig it up to lift the rocks out of the pit?

The Swazis also have another saying heard often: *"Why not?"*

And what do you know, **YebooooOOOO!!!!** it worked! So dope. (The dopest)

### Anchor excavations

Our left and right anchor excavations are like night and day:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/left-side-anchor-excavation.jpg)
*Left side excavation: Remnants of large granite dinosaur eggs*

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/right-side-anchor-excavation.jpg)
*Right side excavation: Dark Chocolate Belgian Lava Cake*

The left side is like a pile of rocks with some dirt sprinkled around; the right side is cakey and soft with no rocks in sight. Needless to say, excavation on the right side has been pure bliss whereas the left side has been a rough time.

To excavate the little bits of dirt in between the big boulders is cumbersomeat best, to move these massive boulder fragments is troublesome, and to figure out how to incorporate the boulders in our bridge is a constant issue. But, we get it done :)

### Bridge cable layout

Once we dug out space for the anchor, cable paths, and abutment walls, we could finally preparev  our anchors on both sides. And this means it's time to cut and lay out our bridge cables!

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/cutting-cables-safety-meeting.jpg)
*Safety meeting pre-cable layout*

The steel wire rope (cable) used in our bridge comes on massive spools that are hauled in on a truck with a hydraulic crane, and we've got to walk out the cables to the necessary lengths and cut it to size for our bridge.

Laying out and cutting bridge cables is a pretty fun day where everybody comes together and unspools, measures, and cuts the cable, and it's overall quite a silly experience.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/carrying-cables.jpg)

From tower to tower our bridge is 83m, and our cables must be cut to 110m for the extra length from our towers to the anchor.

We walked out, cut, and then carried down the first second and third bridge cable no problem, like a breeze. But, when we were going to cut our last cable we made a *startling discovery*....

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/fourth-cable-missing.jpg)
*Where art thou, Bridge Cable #4?*

There wasn't enough rope on the spool for our fourth cable!! The cable we were using was what's leftover from our first bridge last year, and somehwhere along the way we had miscalculated how much cable we actually had left.

Unfortunately that was the last cable that our Swaziland program had in country and it wouldn't be for a many days until we could get our fourth cable.

*Eiiiiish...* When life gives you lemons, well... you know what to do. But what about when life throws you curveballs?

### Anchor pour

Welp, you dodge 'em!

We decided to pour our anchors with a small 4m section of cable in place of our big cable, then we when we get our big cable we can splice it to the small section and pull it through the plastic tubing and into place.

*Pouring the anchor takes heaps of concrete!! We all work together on a line, with people mixing, passing buckets, and pouring in rotation.*

*"Kancane, kancane" the anchor fills up with concrete.*

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/anchor-pour-done.jpg)
*Yeboooooo!!!*

And yebooooooo!!! Worked out great.

### Where we're at now

We're still waiting on our fourth cable to show up on site so we can hoist the cables and begin decking, when this thing starts to really look like a bridge!!

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/building-abutment-walls.jpg)

In the meantime, we're working on our left and right abutment wall excavation and build, which was originally planned to be after our cable hoisting but working on it now will allow us to relentlessly progress forward!

## Team update
![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/dirty-happy-team.jpg)

We are tired, dirty, and happy.

7 weeks ago since we started our tebetebe here and, all things considered, it has been quite the ride. Projects like this are pretty out there to begin with, and for all of us it has been a reeeal experience in many unexpected ways.

One thing is for sure, is that this project has been pretty *strenuous*. Dawg, we're **out here** *onge emalanga* (every day) from sunrise to sunset, in one way or the other working wicked hard to build this *tebetebe*.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/late-nite-anchor-pour.jpg)
*Late night anchor pour, with a lil' drizzle.*

Sometimes that work means pouring anchors into the late evening, or waking up before sunrise to get an extra start for the day, or working pretty much every Saturday to make up for time lost due to various complications. Needless to say, this is no trivial exercise, and we go to bed at 9pmish every night exhausted.

One thing's fo sho, in spite of what are occasionally rough times, we've got eachother! What was once a CU bridge crew is now a CU bridge family --- we are now all ride or die homies and we always keep the up the *umoya* (spirit) and look after eachother.

Here in eSwatini people laugh *all the time* and we've taken to that way of life, taking note to take things lightheartedly and easy :)

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/bridge-site-family.jpg)

Our bridge family is strong as we've gotten to be great friends with some of the community members that show up *onge emalanga* (every day). Homies like Papi, Steh, Joster, Alice, Tandiwe, Thobela, George, Mage Shongwe, Masego, .... brighten our days and we all have tons of fun as we figure this whole footbridge thing out together.

Truth be told, our daily experience here at the bridge site with the community is a great time itself, and we greatly enjoy spending time with our new fam sitting around the evening *umlilo* (fire), sharing good times and learning heaps of their Swazi wisdom, and laughing a lot.

*Every morning we awake to something new in our front yard. This time, some super cute donkey visitors came to do drop off some river sand so that Bongane could build a new hut!*

And, every once in a while we get to leave the bridge site and do some fun things!! This past weekend we were invited to judge a bridge building competition at a Swazi high school science fair which was a grand ole' time.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/bridge-competition-testing.jpg)
*Testing out the structural capacity of the bridges students built! The bridges were judged on aesthetics, economy, and strength. How cool to have a chance to connect with some budding engineers!!*

*We had a pick up game of football with some primary school kids and it was a real hoot. Nobody was keeping score, so I say our team won 10-0*
![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/bridge-competition-goalies.jpg)
*FIERCE goalies*

One other amazing thing is that we're often now getting BEANS for lunch and sometimes even dinner! I frickin love beans.

From the whole team, we all send out immense love to our families who support us on this wild adventure!

### Behind the scenes

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/team-siboniso2.jpg)
*CU bridge building squad with our main man Jabulo*

Behind every bridge building squad is a community of people, and we are grateful for our all of the support we have received both for this footbridge build and throughout the years. While our CU Boulder team is 7 strong, we wish to give a shoutout to those behind the scenes.

**Fun fact:** every bridge building crew have a group of professionals called bridge corps that help with our design and implementation of the footbridge.

In particular, we want to give a shout out to *mnaketfu* Bridge Corps Jabulo also known as Chris Busch, who out of his own free time came down to spend 2 weeks with us on site during our *critical construction* phase, and our other main *mnaketfu*, CUB2P bridge legend Harry McElroy for all of his help on bridge design.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/first-safety-circle.jpg)
*The illustrious Vusi (Mavusana) Program Manager Sam Sweet*

We also must send out our utmost thanks to our debonair Program Manager Sam Vusi Sweet who has been such a great friend and mentor to our team throughout our bridge build process.

For those who don't know, it's a pretty wild and often complicated thing to build a footbridge in eSwatini, a job that takes navigating political and logistical hurdles, and Vusi is doing a great job at handling that for us, while being just a great presence in general.

We love you Vusi!!

***One more fun fact:** We thank the Engineering Excellence Fund at the University of Colorado Boulder for granting us our survey equipment! Siyabonga kakhulu!!*

### We love you all!! Thank you for reading!!

Stay tuned for our further updates as we charge to completion to the bridge!!

Hamba kahle y'all, siyabonga kakhulu!!
