## Previously on CUB2P Bolivia

*CUB2P Team on site in Chosco Bolivia 2017*

Over the 2016-17 school year, the CU Bridges to Prosperity team prepared for a footbridge construction in the rural community of Surumajchi Bolivia. However, upon their arrival to the site last summer, there was an issue with the ownership of the land for the footbridge, where a farmer that had previously agreed to donate his land now refused to do so.

Their original plans now foiled, the CU team searched for a new footbridge to build, ultimately ending up with a site in Chosco Bolivia. A massive feat of tenacity and perseverence, the CU team designed the bridge for the new site in only a short few days and set off for the build.

The build overall went very well, however the team had been delayed a few weeks in the scramble and were not able to complete the bridge last summer. However, we were determined to complete the bridge, and this summer we packed our bags once again to finish what we started.

And while to build just half a bridge seemed like a straightforward proposal, it ended up being anything but....

## This Time Around

*After many months of coordination and skype calls....united at last!!*

Our journey began on the 16th of May as the Boulder team finally met with the students from University of Illinois, and friendships were formed quickly, helped along by our shared excitement for the upcoming bridge build.

At last, construction began on Monday, May 21st, with the excavation of the left anchor, and we found ourselves challenged both physically and mentally by the feat of excavating 30+ cubic meters of fractured shale for the abutment.

We started on the right anchor about one and a half weeks in. Though the work was difficult, we always had a great time at work, having so much fun with each other and the wonderful community members of Chosco. On June 13th, our wonderful Bridge Corps member Zoey Craun, joined us and we began critical construction.

*Wicked bad cables, with kinks and frayed wires and whatnot...not safe!!*

Zoey inspected the cables and was displeased with the quality of cables due to welds, kinks, and frayed wires, finding them to be unusable. Crunched on time, Zoey and Mia went on a mission to Cochabamba that weekend to get new cables. When they came back on the 17th, we swapped out the old cables with the new ones, and poured anchors the following week. We were ready for Jay on the 24th.

Jay, with his incredible knowledge and experience, assisted in setting sag, cable reductions, tarring cables, grouting tubes, and decking. To finish the last critical parts of the bridge, we worked several 18 hour work days.

Finally, we left Chosco with an almost completed bridge that the community would be able to finish on their own. All that was left to be done was the right abutment approach ramp wall, fill to be completed, and concrete topping slab to be placed. 

We want to thank all of you for your unlimited support. Here are some more pics from our trip!
