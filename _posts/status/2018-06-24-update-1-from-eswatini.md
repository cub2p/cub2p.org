## Sanbonani y’all!!!

Our CUB2P bridge building crew is coming to you live from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, in particular from the wonderful Kingdom of eSwatini (formerly known as Swaziland), where we are currently building a footbridge with the community of Endlembeni in the northwest part of the country.

It has been a whirlwind many days since we landed in Johannesburg with bright eyes and big plans for the coming weeks. And, all things considered, so far so good!!

Here's what has been happening so far on the trip!

*Happy team at a rest stop on the M3*

Cruising down the M3 highway from Johannesburg to eSwatini is a rite of passage for eSwatini bridge builders, and for many of our team this was their first time in southern Africa. With loud upbeat music jamming on the minibus sound system, a plethora of new sights out the window, and a distinct smell of burning coal from all of the power plants, we were all full of excitement for what lay next.

*Meeting with the Principal Secratery*

Bright and early Monday morning we woke up, took a deep breath, and hit the road to meet with one of our partners in the country, Swaziland MicroProjects. MicroProjects is a parastatal organization that facilitates community development projects around the kingdom and is an essential partner in our projects.

MicroProjects provides the raw materials such as cement, crushed stone, and reinforcemnet used in our bridges and are a major advocate for us. They are also learning the process of bridge construction from us so that they may replicate it themselves, which is very cool.

We met with the director Mr. Mbingo who passionately thanked us for our work and bestowed much encouragement for our project. To have the support from MicroProjects is to have the wind at our back, and we are so grateful!

*First arrival to the homestead...!*

Beaming with resolve, we left the meeting and hit the road towards our bridge site. Just before sundown we turned from the paved road to a bumpy dirt one as we went along a ridge and made our way down to our bridge site.

As we bumped along slowly on that ole’ dirt road, it became clear that the place we’re building the bridge is just absolutely beautiful. Pictures won’t do justice the loveliness of these rolling hills peppered with quaint homestetads, but here’s a panorama nonetheless.

Towards the bottom of the hill our procession of eager bridge building students met a group of lovely hospitable community members with whom we would be staying. Together we arranged ourselves in a circle, the favourite shape of community projects, and made a round of introductions. From our circle it was clear we were working with a supportive community that very much desired a footbridge, and also to our delight there was a decent amount of English literacy among the community.

The Shongwe homestead had provided us with a hut for us to stay and soon we had made it our home, laying down copius amounts of sleeping pads and bags and soon we were all off to sleep. After months of bridge designing, fundraising, and planning, we were finally finally there.

*Construction Manager Mandla marking the centerline and right abutment for the bridge*

During all our months of preparation for this trip, we were acutely aware that we were going to build a footbridge. That was the plan. But it ain’t real until it’s real, and I for one woke up Tuesday with the thought, “*eish*, now we have to build this thing!”

Have you ever built a 83-meter suspended footbridge? Guaranteed, It’s no small task. It involves a whole lot of foreplanning and heaps upon HEAPS of manual labour. But, considering the massive positive impact it has we believe it is well worth the effort.

*Excavation crew on the left side abutment*

The bridges we build consist of many parts including massive abutments from which the bridge's cables will hang. For these abutments as well as for the bridge anchors, we must do literally TONNES of excavation by hand.

Tonnes of excavation means tonnes of hard labour, and for the next many weeks we will work alongside community members pick axeing, digging, moving sand and rock, mixing concrete, more digging and more pick axeing, more moving sand and rock, and more mixing concrete.

*Filling the right side foundation*

The right side of our bridge is located in a repurposed farm field so the excavation there was cake as the land had been tilled many a time. In fact, the soil here is a thick cakey dark brown just like chocolate lava cake.

In no time we had excavated the land needed for the abutment foundation and the masons had made quick work of the foundation construction. However, as we began to unearth the soil for the left abutment excavation, we made a startling discovery.

*Eish! Matche gakhulu in the the left side abutment*

A prehistoric dinosaur had laid many massive, solid granite eggs on the hillside right where our design had set our abutments and anchors to be. These rocks range from *hard to move* to **impossible to move** and present a huge problem for us.

It's not that the rocks must be moved out of the way of our foundations--in fact, we can incorporate these rocks into the bridge. The issue is that we must excavate to the required depth for our design and these boulders prevent us from excavating beneath them safely by hand.

*Eish, some more big ones in our anchor excavation*

Thus began a dilemma that left us to remove our hard hats to scratch our heads--dog gone, how on earth are we going to move these rocks? We don't have access to heavy machinery (and if we did we couldn't get it to such a steep site), and we were stumped for how to continue.

This led us to a discussion with the community--who better to ask about moving massive boulders that are common throughout eSwatini than the Swazis themselves?

*Controlled burn in the left side abutment*

Some community members suggested to set up a controlled burn involving wood and old tires underneath the rocks, and then afterwards to hit the rock with a sledgehammer and it would break right in half.

While we held a decent bit of skepticism for this method being effective, we nonetheless decided to give it a shot as it was our only feasable option. We implemented a safety plan for the burn including brush clearing, wetting down the surrounding grass, and having hoses and buckets at the ready, and one day after work gave it a shot.

*Left abutment after the burn*

To our delight it was very effective! If there are any physicists, chemists, or otherwise knowledgeable people in the audience that could shed light on how please let us know because we can't seem to agree about how it works.

*Moving massive boulders is a team effort*

Now in bite size pieces, we began the process of moving rocks, excavating beneath them, and then moving them back. And while I described that process in just one sentence let me tell you it is a huge task on the ground.

Though these big ole boulders have slowed our progress, on the contrary our spirit is thriving! We are learning all sorts of siSwati and making heaps of new friends on the job site, and laughing at least 20 times per day.

Here are a couple more pics from our time here on the site!

*Program Manager Vusi has been supplying us with a steady dose of materials for our bridge! To procure materials in eSwatini is a hassle at best, and we thank Vusi for all his help in navigating those hassles!*

Thank you all so much for reading!! We are all having a blast here and do stay tuned for some more updates.
