![Swaziland Community Survey]({{ "/img/swazi-communitysurvey.jpg" | prepend:site.baseurl }})

The University of Colorado chapter of Bridges to Prosperity (CUB2P) is a university chapter of the non-profit organization Bridges to Prosperity. We are a group of skilled and passionate individuals who believe in bettering the world through constructing footbridges. Since our clubs' founding in 2011, our group has helped construct 7 footbridges with communities in Bolivia, Swaziland, and Nicaragua.

Each school year we design a footbridge for a community in need, and in the summer build the bridge alongside community members. By constructing footbridges, we vastly improve the lives of isolated rural communities who face dangerous river crossings and are often cut off from access to essential services during floods.
